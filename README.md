## Getting Started

- Fork this repository with Github
- Make sure that the wiki and issues features are disabled for your fork

## Process

1. Go to the issues page to find one to work on
  - Choose a 'p1' issue that you find interesting
  - Open this issue and read about it in the description and comments
  - Find your favorite issue that references the one you have open
  - Repeat from the second bullet point until you reach an unassigned leaf
  - Assign the issue you found to yourself and begin working on it
2. Work on fixing the issue
  - Make sure you assigned the issue you are working on to yourself
  - Create a branch in git for the issue you are working on
  - Start making your changes in that branch and commit/push often
  - If there is something you are getting too hung up on, create a referencing issue
  - When you are done with your change write a unit test to go along with it
3. Pull requests/code reviews
  - Before you create your pull request, pull from upstream and run your tests
  - When you think you've fixed the issue (and all of its children referencing issues) create a pull request for your branch
  - Ask one of your peers for a code review with an '@' mention
  - They will run your tests and send it back if they don't pass
  - If they do pass they will read your code and comment on all the things they don't like
  - Once they are satisfied with it, they will comment 'LGTM' or looks good to me
  - After they do this I will code review it and if it gets past me it will be merged upstream and everyone must pull
