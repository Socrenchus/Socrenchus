Tag Box
====================

### About

Similar to youtube's tagging feature on their videos.  The user may start typing a tag, and then this UI element
will select tags that it feels are similar or would complete the user's selected word.  These suggested words would
have to actually be selected to be added to the actual tag list.  This will also include both the topic tag functionality
as well as rubrick tag functionality.  This means that when the tag box is supposed to be rubrick based, it will have a 
positive or negative button signifying what was correct or incorrect about the answer.

### Blueprint

#### The Tag Entry

A simple text box, where the tags the user wants to add are separated by commas or spaces.

#### Tag suggestions (planned)

Clickable buttons that will be displayed on the bottom of the tag entry box.
