Notify
====================

### About

This is a button that displays the number of unread notifications that a user has waiting for them.  When that is clicked, a window pops up next to it displaying those notifications.

### Dynamic Positioning

The positioning of the pop up window can be set relative to the button.  The values topright, topleft, righttop, lefttop, bottomright, bottomleft, rightbottom, and leftbottom are currently used.
