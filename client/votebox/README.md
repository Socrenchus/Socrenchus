Votebox
====================

### About

A simple up or down vote UI element.  These would be two buttons, one allowing the user to 'upvote' answers they agree with
and the other being a 'downvote' for answers they do not agree with.  It would also keep track of the net amount of votes in 
between these two images.

### Blueprint

### Customizable images

Programmer can select the images to be used for the up and down vote arrows.

### Vote Tracker

Will find the total upvotes and total downvotes and figure out from there what the net votes are and display them.
This should be customizable to display or not display.
